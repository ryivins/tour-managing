# Tour Retrospective

## What Went Well
- Load-ins and changeovers were on schedule  
- Promoter communication stayed clear and proactive  
- Budget variance remained within contingency  
- Photo/media captured consistently across dates  

## What Could Be Improved
- Earlier venue confirmations to avoid routing stress  
- Centralized merch counts per night to reduce shrinkage  
- Travel buffer windows on long-haul days  

## Lessons Learned
- Daily check-ins + single source of truth (itinerary) prevent drift  
- Pre-tour tech check and spare media save headaches  
- Documenting small incidents helps improve the next run  

## Next Steps
- Automate expense capture; weekly budget snapshot  
- Standardize promoter info sheet & show-day checklist  
- Create a lightweight media delivery pipeline post-show
