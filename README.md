# ðŸŽ¶ Daisy Chain Tour Management

Daisy Chain Tour Management provides full-service tour management both on the road and remotely.  
From **budgeting** and **itinerary creation** to **seamless communication** with promoters and venues, this proposal outlines how tours can run smoothly and efficiently.  

In addition to logistics, scheduling, and financial oversight, services include:  
- Professional photography & media coverage  
- Merchandise coordination  
- Detailed documentation  

This allows artists to focus on their craft while the details behind the scenes are managed effectively.
